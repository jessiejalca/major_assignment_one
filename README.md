# Making a Movement

**_UCF DIG 3174: Front-End Web Design, Major Assignment One_**

The objective of this project is to practice new responsive design skills using HTML and CSS only, by creating a single-page site that explains and reflects a movement in art, culture, or music. I chose the Bauhaus movement.
